Feel free to do whatever you want with this as long as you link back to here if you publicly display a modified version.  Thanks!

# Usage

Open screen or tmux and in a window run `PASSWORD=<password> ./auto_gen_server.sh`

You'll need to do some editing to get it working at first as some config is only accessible in the script.
